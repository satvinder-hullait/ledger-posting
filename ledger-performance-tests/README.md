# Gatling plugin for Gradle - Java demo project

Load test of ledger service to run:

* Ensure relevant dependant services are running using the docker-compose in the root of this repo
* Ensure the ledger service is running
* In the terminal in this project run `./gradlew gatlingRun`

**NOTE: This is not configurable and in a real world environment it would be so and the scenarios more realistic.**
